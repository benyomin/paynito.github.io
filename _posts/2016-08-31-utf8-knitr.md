I have avoided trying R Markdown in R-Studio until I watched a video by showing [how easy it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP8WvZ8LgJ8).
So, I thought that I would take a break from [org-babel](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-R.html) and the kramdown markdown of the last two posts and try knitr inside R-Studio.  I immediately got a pandoc error 43. Knitr doesn't like my name written in Hebrew. I usually compile with ```latexmk -xelatex eg1.tex``` because I found XeLaTeX and polyglossia easier to use than LaTeX and Babel. Perhaps knitr isn't set up to do Right to Left foreign languages out of the box. I'll have to put off learning about the ["Knit with Parameters"](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html) feature until another day.
