I think I spent two or three days trying to map in R about 6 months ago, but I couldn't find the shape files for Israel, even after visiting the 
University GIS lab.
Found the shape files today.  http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata  (Click Israel and Administrative areas)
Direct link is  http://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/diva/adm/ISR_adm.zip
So that can be added to your R script with curl or wget.

{% highlight R %}
99
{% endhighlight %}
