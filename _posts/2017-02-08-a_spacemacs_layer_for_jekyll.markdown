hmm, seems that the org-export to .md function has disappeared.
Prompted me to try a new blogging layer for spacemacs.

I hope it doesn't require too many changes to my old setup.

Seems like I will have to modify the template generator for the 
yaml header section of new
posts. It leaves out the language and date variables I need to sort my
posts.

blogging with the jekyll layer involves hitting SPC a j when you have a
file open in emacs in your blog's directory. hmm.
