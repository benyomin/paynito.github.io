You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage{setspace}
\doublespacing
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage[notes, isbn=false, backend=biber]{biblatex-chicago}
\bibliography{statsBooks.bib}
\author{בנימן הגלילי}
. . .
\newpage
\nocite{*}
\printbibliography
\end{document}

{% endhighlight %}
